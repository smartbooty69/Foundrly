## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/foundrly.git
    cd foundrly
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment:**

    Create `.env.local` and fill in the following:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=your_dataset
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_API_VERSION=2023-10-01
    SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN=your_write_token
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
    NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
    GITHUB_ID=your_github_oauth_id
    GITHUB_SECRET=your_github_oauth_secret
    ```

4.  **Run the app:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Visit `http://localhost:3000` to use the platform locally.

## Usage

  - Browse a live feed of startup pitches.
  - Log in using GitHub to manage your own startup submissions.
  - View any user‚Äôs profile and see what startups they‚Äôve shared.
  - Use the search bar to filter ideas based on relevance and category.

## Authentication

Authentication is handled via NextAuth with GitHub as the provider. When users log in, their profile is auto-created in Sanity if not already present. Sessions are maintained across pages and API routes using server-side sessions.

## User Profile

Each user has a dedicated profile page displaying:

  - Name
  - Username
  - Avatar
  - Bio
  - All submitted startups

Static site generation with dynamic data fetching is used to optimize performance and SEO.

## Startup Submission

Logged-in users can submit startup pitches through a dedicated form. Fields include:

  - Title
  - Description
  - Category
  - Image URL
  - Rich-text pitch body

Validation is enforced both on the client and server. All data is synced with Sanity CMS in real time.

## Performance Monitoring

Sentry is integrated to track:

  - Errors and exceptions
  - Latency and performance bottlenecks
  - API failures

This helps maintain app health in both development and production environments.

## Deployment

To deploy on Vercel:

1.  **Push the code to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/foundrly.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```
