## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Sanity account (for CMS)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/foundrly.git
    cd foundrly
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```

4. Configure your environment variables in `.env.local`:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
    NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
    SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
    NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
    BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN=your_blob_token
    ```

### Development

Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Image Upload Setup

#### Local Development
Image uploads work out of the box in local development. Files are stored in the `public/uploads/` directory.

#### Production (Vercel)
For production deployment on Vercel:

1. **Enable Vercel Blob Storage**:
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to Storage â†’ Blob
   - Create a new Blob store
   - Copy the `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` to your environment variables

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Add `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` to your Vercel project environment variables
   - Redeploy your application

The application automatically detects the environment and uses:
- **Local storage** for development
- **Vercel Blob storage** for production

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Usage

  - Browse a live feed of startup pitches.
  - Log in using GitHub to manage your own startup submissions.
  - View any user's profile and see what startups they've shared.
  - Use the search bar to filter ideas based on relevance and category.

## Authentication

Authentication is handled via NextAuth with GitHub as the provider. When users log in, their profile is auto-created in Sanity if not already present. Sessions are maintained across pages and API routes using server-side sessions.

## User Profile

Each user has a dedicated profile page displaying:

  - Name
  - Username
  - Avatar
  - Bio
  - All submitted startups

Static site generation with dynamic data fetching is used to optimize performance and SEO.

## Startup Submission

Logged-in users can submit startup pitches through a dedicated form. Fields include:

  - Title
  - Description
  - Category
  - Image URL
  - Rich-text pitch body

Validation is enforced both on the client and server. All data is synced with Sanity CMS in real time.

## Performance Monitoring

Sentry is integrated to track:

  - Errors and exceptions
  - Latency and performance bottlenecks
  - API failures

This helps maintain app health in both development and production environments.

## Deployment

To deploy on Vercel:

1.  **Push the code to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/foundrly.git
    git push -u origin main
    ```
2.  Connect the GitHub repo to Vercel.
3.  Add all required environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.
